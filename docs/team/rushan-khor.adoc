=== Enhancement Added: Batch deletion of contacts by tag

==== External behaviour

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=batch]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Batch deletions make it less tedious to perform deletions on multiple contacts.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Display potential duplicate contacts

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=dups]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Duplicate contacts can accumulate over time. The `duplicates` command compiles a list of potential duplicate contacts for the user to review.

=== Enhancement Added: Copy contact email address to clipboard

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=copy]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Embracing the keyboard-centric interaction of MedNus, even copying data into the userâ€™s clipboard is possible using purely keyboard commands. The Copy command lets users do just that.

=== Enhancement Proposed

* Skype username field and ability to pull contacts from Skype
** This is useful for telemedicine / telehealth which is essentially remote doctor consulting facilitated by video-calls
** This would further solidify MedNus's relevance as a forward-looking product for medical professionals
* Command that maps (patient contacts) with (doctor contacts specialising in their illness) and drafts referral letters for them
** This is useful for private doctors in particular, for whom networks of referrals are poorly documented, yet crucial to their business

=== Other contributions

* Drafted a light UI theme
* Revamped the Developer Guide content with Eric
