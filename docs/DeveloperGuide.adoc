== Introduction

Welcome to MedNus! MedNus is a contacts application for busy doctors.
It is designed to be completely operable without the user taking their hands off
their keyboard. This developer guide tells new developers how the project is
structured, and contains a summary of component API calls for experienced
developers.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK] `1.8.0_60`* or later
. *https://www.jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ]* IDE
. Enable the *Gradle and JavaFx plugins* (installed by default)

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ. Click Import Project.
. Locate the build.gradle file and select it.
. Click Open as Project, accepting the default settings.
. This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Run the seedu.address.MainApp and try some commands.
. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.

=== Necessary configurations before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards] instead of IntelliJ's default style (particularly for import statement ordering).

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. And then go to `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

== Design

=== Architecture

_Figure 2.1.1 : The Architecture Diagram below explains the high-level design of the App._

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` is written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]). It is used for communication amongst components in an event-driven manner.
* `LogsCenter` is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components with longer write-ups in the following sections. Here is a summary:

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] is the UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] is the command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Keep in mind that each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

=== UI component

_Figure 2.2.1 : UML diagram of the UI Component showing how it is structured_

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Note the `XYZCommand` class on the right of the diagram. Its structure is detailde in the next figure.

_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Events-driven nature of the design

_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions *within the Logic Component* for the `delete 1` Command_

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]


=== Model component

_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Address Book data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `Storage` component:

* Can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== *Enhancement: Command Box Keyboard Shortcuts*

*Reason for implementation* +

Such a feature is implemented to enhance the experience of users and allows developers to debug +
newly implemented features with greater ease that requires the use of the command input text box. +

The feature allows users and developers to easily navigate and edit input text.

*How is it implemented* +

There are three key improvements that the enhancement brings

1. Navigation

* Shifting cursor all the way to the
** Start using SHIFT-ALT +
by setting the caret position to 0
** End using SHIFT-CONTROL +
by setting the caret position to the length of the input text which brings +
the caret all the way to the right.

* Shifting cursor by chunks (word/empty spaces) +
in the scenario where the user does not want to travel all the way to the end but also +
does not want to manually shift right by 1 cursor space every time.
** Shift Left using ALT +
by first checking if a black space or character is on the left and shifting until +
a character or blank space is found respectively
** Shift Right using CONTROL +
by first checking if a black space or character is on the right and shifting until +
a character or blank space is found respectively

2. Deletion

* Deleting all text by pressing the ESCAPE key +
which resets the input text field in the commandTextField

* Deletes by chunk (word/blank space) +
for users who do not want to delete the entire text input and do not want to manually delete +
character by character. +
** Chunks are deleted by covering all possible text deletion combination of characters and blank space, +
using the following order as check formula +
1.Checks if caret is at the start of text +
2.Checks if caret is at the end of text +
3.Checks for empty space before +
4.Checks if caret is between characters +
5.Else, assumes that blank space is present on the right and character is present on the left.


3. Usage of Add Command +
* Purpose: As the text required to create a contact can be long with all the required prefixes, +
this shortcut eliminates the need for users to memorize the order in which the prefixes are needed +
and eliminates the need to remember what prefixes are needed even if in random order.

* Logic: +
+
First, check if caret is at the end of the text +
+
Secondly, check if valid add command keyword is present at the start of the text +
+
Next, checks which prefix is missing from the text needed to create the person and adds on to the existing text +
based on the priority of : name, phone, email, address, bloodtype and tag. +
+
If all necessary prefixes are present, subsequent concatenation will be that of the tag prefix.


*Reason for how it is implemented*

* Using of Shift-Key +
Shift key is needed to minimize the number of keys used. +
+
Firstly, if a certain function such as left navigation is tagged to ALT, an association is formed and it will be easy for users to remember +
+
Secondly, we want to avoid using the alphabet keys and other important keys which may already possess usable functionalities.

* Brute Force +
Many of the commands are done by doing a brute force checking of all possible combinations +
though not ideal, it is workable as there is only a limited number of combinations not exceeding 5. +
+
Brute force is used to eliminate the need to throw exceptions which can never be called which in turn +
adversely affect test coverage as these exception can never be thrown.

*Future enhancements*

* Add Command Shortcut: As of now, Prefixes are hard-coded to reflect existing available prefixes +
+
Potential enhancements involves syncing the shortcut to the CliSyntax.java file to obtain the necessary +
prefixes

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

There are three ways to run tests. Method 3 is the most reliable, given how GUI tests may fail becaues of platform / resolution-specific idiosyncracies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
